Dependency is managed using gradle. These dependencies are required for the app:
implementation 'com.android.volley:volley:1.2.0'
implementation 'org.jsoup:jsoup:1.14.2'
	
The app can be run using a Virtual Device provided by the Android emulator in Android Studio IDE. 
Alternatively, an APK file can be created using the Android Studio IDE by going to the menubar and navigating to "Build" > "Build Bundle(s) / APK (s) > "Build APK (s)". This APK file will be saved on the PC, which can then be transferred to an android phone.
